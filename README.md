Apoyo Venezuela is a mobile-first, crowd-coordination web app created after the June 24, 2026 earthquake in Venezuela (a doublet of roughly M7.1 and M7.5). It lets people report affected zones, post needs per location, mark structural status, and consult verified emergency phone numbers.

## About

What the app does:

- **Interactive map of affected zones** with a structural-status traffic light (collapsed, damaged, stable, unconfirmed), always shown as color plus icon plus text label.
- **Zone reporting** with address autocomplete, reverse geocoding, geolocation, or by dragging a pin on the map, including photo uploads restricted to safe raster image types.
- **Needs per zone** (rescue, water, food, medicine, shelter, and more) with a lifecycle of needed, then on the way, then covered.
- **Verified emergency phone directory** by state, with tap-to-call and the source of each number.
- **Aid guide**: what to donate and what to avoid, shelters and collection centers, aid organizations.
- **Link to the sister project** for missing persons: [desaparecidosterremotovenezuela.com](https://desaparecidosterremotovenezuela.com).
- **Live updates** on the map and lists via Supabase Realtime.
- **PWA**, light and dark mode, mobile-first.

## Tech stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) + React 19 + strict TypeScript.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with design tokens defined in `app/globals.css` via `@theme`.
- **Map**: Leaflet + react-leaflet using OpenStreetMap tiles (no API key). Address autocomplete and reverse geocoding use the Mapbox Geocoding API (optional; see below).
- **Data**: Supabase (Postgres + Realtime); validation with Zod.
- **Icons**: lucide-react.
- **Tests**: Vitest.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Demo mode**: with no environment variables, the app runs in demo mode using an in-memory store with sample data for the affected zones. Data is not shared between users in this mode, so it is ideal for trying the app locally without any backend.

## Connecting Supabase

To use live, shared data, set both of these variables (for example in `.env.local` or in your hosting provider's panel):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```

When both are set, the app uses Supabase automatically instead of demo mode.

For production, also set `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (a server-only, service_role-equivalent key). All server-side data access prefers this key over the anon key, and the anon client has no direct table access once the lockdown migration is applied.

```bash
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
```

> `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` is never prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, so it never ships in the browser bundle. The anon key still ships in the bundle (it is used for demo/local fallback and browser realtime), but it no longer has direct table access in production; never expose the `service_role` key or any secret key beyond the server environment.

## Address autocomplete (Mapbox)

The report form can autocomplete addresses and reverse-geocode a dropped pin using the Mapbox Geocoding API. Set a Mapbox access token to enable it (for example in `.env.local`):

```bash
MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.your-mapbox-token
```

The token is read only on the server (it is not prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, so it never ships in the browser bundle), and requests are biased to Venezuela. Restrict the token by URL in the Mapbox dashboard. Without a token the form still works: autocomplete returns no suggestions and the user places the pin manually, falling back to the per-state approximate location.

## Database

The schema lives in the `supabase/migrations/` directory as a series of migration files: the tables `locations` and `needs`, indexes, RLS policies, the Realtime publication, and photo support.

Apply the migrations with the Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase db push
```

Alternatively, paste the SQL into the SQL editor in the Supabase panel.

The server reads and writes with `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, which bypasses Row Level Security. The anon and authenticated roles have no direct table grants on `locations` or `needs`: every read and write goes through the server (Server Components, Route Handlers, Server Actions), so this is still an emergency tool with no login, just without exposing the tables directly to anon clients. Status updates route through `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs; delete is never exposed publicly. Public delete stays closed on purpose so nobody can wipe another person's report.

To remove an erroneous report, a maintainer runs the admin script (it uses the authenticated Supabase CLI, so it needs no service-role key). It deletes the location row, its needs cascade, and its Storage photos:

```bash
npm run delete-report -- --find "San Bernardino"   # find the report id
npm run delete-report -- <location-uuid>            # preview, confirm, delete
```

## Emergency data

Phone numbers and resources were collected from public sources and marked verified when confirmed by at least one credible source. Lines can be saturated or change, so **verify a number before calling**.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Data corrections (phone numbers, shelters, organizations) are especially valuable, and each correction should include its source. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details, and please keep the project's conventions: design tokens, lucide icons, and strictly non-partisan content.
